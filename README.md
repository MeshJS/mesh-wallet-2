# mesh-wallet

`mesh-wallet` is a package whose primary usage will be to allow dapps to sign transactions and messages from a private key or mnemonic.

It has an extended functionality to allow for a simulation of CIP-30 endpoints using a Cardano data provider such as Blockfrost/Maestro.

NOTE: These are not a perfect replication of CIP-30 endpoints, CIP-30 requires a dedicated node and indexer realistically. The wallet therefore does not do any key derivations, and will only by default, derive keys for index 0 on all related derivation paths (payment, stake, drep).

It is possible that when querying balance for example, the same mnemonic will produce different results to a real wallet implementation, since real wallets will index multiple key derivations and search on-chain

## Usage

### Signing Transactions

#### Deriving from mnemonic

```typescript
const wallet = await MeshWallet.fromMnemonic({
  mnemonic:
    "globe cupboard camera aim congress cradle decorate enter fringe dove margin witness police coral junk genius harbor fire evolve climb rather broccoli post snack".split(
      " "
    ),
  networkId: 0,
  walletAddressType: AddressType.Base,
  fetcher: fetcher,
});

wallet.signTx(txHex);
```

The `BaseCardanoWallet` mostly needs a fetcher to function properly, because when signing a txCborHex, the wallet searches through the transaction to identify which part of the wallet needs to sign the transaction. Without a fetcher, input information cannot be obtained, and signing functionality doesn't work.

#### Blind signing

If you wanted to blindly sign a transaction (without first attempting to identify IF the wallet needs to sign). Then it is possible by using the more primitive classes that `BaseCardanoWallet` or `MeshWallet` was built upon.

#### In Memory BIP32

The `InMemoryBip32` Class allows users to derive keys from a mnemonic, it is denoted as "In memory" because both the mnemonic and derived keys will be stored in memory. It may be possible to create your own `Bip32` Class that doesn't store anything in memory, as long as the interface stays the same.

```typescript
const bip32 = await InMemoryBip32.fromMnemonic(
  "globe cupboard camera aim congress cradle decorate enter fringe dove margin witness police coral junk genius harbor fire evolve climb rather broccoli post snack".split(
    " "
  )
);

const paymentSigner = await bip32.getSigner([
  1852 + HARDENED_OFFSET,
  1815 + HARDENED_OFFSET,
  0 + HARDENED_OFFSET,
  0,
  0,
]);

paymentSigner.sign(txHash);
```

This would return the raw signature from the payment key. You can do this for any derivation paths.

#### CardanoSigner

The previous code snippet allows you to generate raw signatures, but in Cardano, generally a raw signature isn't very useful. CIP-30 for example, requires signatures to be wrapped in a `TransactionWitnessSet` and encoded as CBOR. To facilitate this, we have the `CardanoSigner` class.

```typescript
const txWitnessSet = CardanoSigner.signTx(txHex, [paymentSigner]);
```

Furthermore, it might be somewhat useful to simply add the signature to the full transaction, ready for submission. There is a `returnFullTx` tag, that if set to `true` returns the entire tx CBOR hex with the signature added.

```typescript
const signedTx = CardanoSigner.signTx(txHex, [paymentSigner], true);
```

#### Other derivation paths

The `MeshWallet` class is quite good out of the box as a single address wallet, but if you wanted to use other derivation paths, it is possible, but will be slightly more cumbersome.

`MeshWallet` has a constructor that allows custom `payment`, `staking` and `drep` credential sources. Note that these constructors do accept `scriptHash` or `ISigner` except for `payment` key.

`payment` key has to be able to be used for signing, but it is fully possible to use `scriptHash` for the staking and/or drep part. The wallet will not attempt to sign with any `scriptHash` keys, but will use them to derive the `BaseAddress` and `DrepIds`.

```typescript
const paymentSigner = await bip32.getSigner([
  1852 + HARDENED_OFFSET,
  1815 + HARDENED_OFFSET,
  0 + HARDENED_OFFSET,
  0,
  5,
]);

const wallet = await MeshWallet.fromCredentialSources({
  networkId: 0,
  walletAddressType: AddressType.Enterprise,
  paymentCredentialSource: {
    type: "signer",
    signer: paymentSigner,
  },
});
```

#### Raw Ed25519PrivateKey

It is also possible to create `BaseSigner` instances from raw `Ed25519PrivateKey`, both `fromExtendedKeyHex` and `fromNormalKeyHex` are supported.

```typescript
const paymentSigner = BaseSigner.fromNormalKeyHex(
  "d4ffb1e83d44b66849b4f16183cbf2ba1358c491cfeb39f0b66b5f811a88f182"
);

const wallet = await MeshWallet.fromCredentialSources({
  networkId: 0,
  walletAddressType: AddressType.Enterprise,
  paymentCredentialSource: {
    type: "signer",
    signer: paymentSigner,
  },
});
```
